# ESP8266_The-game-of-life
The project is an implementation of Conwayâ€™s Game of Life on a 16x16 LED matrix using an ESP8266. Cells change states based on predefined rules. The program detects stable structures, marking them purple, and identifies static board states, turning LEDs blue. Users can set the initial live cell count for varied simulations.
